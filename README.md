## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project uses the  established conventions for semantic versioning for its tagging which are listed below.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the

   1. **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
   2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
   3. **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Install the git-log graph extension

To better visulize the git workflow I have installed the free git-log graph tool
[git_log_graph](https://github.com/phil294/git-log--graph#readme)
